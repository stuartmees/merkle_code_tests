# Merkle Code Test : Stuart Mees

* Clone repo and 'npm install' - to install jest.
* To run tests for all tasks except balance.js run 'npm test' 
* balance.js file invokes the function and will log the test case approximate results to the console. Results were not close enough to suggested answers to use jest.

Thanks!
